                  I started using a computer when I was 7 years old, I was
                  obsessed with gaming! But while I was only doing games, I
                  developed interests in software, I began to ask myself about
                  those programs on my desktop, I have never checked them I was
                  always going for the game icons. The day I started to use
                  photoshop everything changed, I loved it and I developed an
                  interest in graphic design, I thought that I will be doing
                  that for the rest of my life, but thought changed when I got
                  to college, I started programming, it wasn't fun at first, I
                  already knew HTML & CSS and some JS but that wasn't helping me
                  understanding C# & C++, I didn't like building apps for
                  windows using WinForm so I started work on my web skills and I
                  picked Node.js & React and never looked back.
